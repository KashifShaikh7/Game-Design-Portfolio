        I was really Inpired by the game - Dunk Shot. The Idea was simple, the player have to jump on platforms that spawn in front, by holding tap to charge power. The players have to take 
        quick action to land on the next platform. The Level keeps on getting harder an player progresses, introducing new platforms like moving logs and traps.

        This is a game similar to one I used to play years ago. Maybe you can guess. It's was one of the flash games called Bubble Trouble. The player clicks to fire knifes,
        if it hits the fruit, the fruit gets divided in smaller fruits. this happenes until its cherry and destroying it no more divides. If any fruit hits the knife, the game is 
        over (ya, I know it makes no sense). The difficulty in this game is made by the player itself in order to complete level.

        Cooking chaos was an concept which came to my mind when I was getting started with VR. ya, thats one to one replica of cooking fever 2D classic game. Beside the 
        restaurant setup, The project was never started in any game Engine.

        Our first ever team project (4 peoples). We did concept, GDD, story, made all the assets and characters. but never got it in a game Engine. Why because, we dont had any animators,
        no experience, was our first time. The team members were my classmates, some were doing, some were not. And soo many reasons. We definitely should have a leader or it's
        not called a team. umm.. so this was not a team project?

        Inspired from Inside and Prince of Persia the lost crown. And the story of my fire guy, final guy was born. I tried designing two levels. It was an interesting project as I learned, how actually the 3D side scrolling game Environments actually works.

        So the main task was to make a game like beat saber. And I took this spooky theme. So there is a spawner in front of player which spawn skulls after a delay. We have to
        kill these monsters with out cursed sword. If you miss some skulls the game is over. I learned a lot of things while playing other VR games too, like the labs - long bow, covert
        syndrome. I came to know that. Player physical movement is the key (mostly hands). And hence I loved to play long bow, which made my hands feel pain of using a bow.
