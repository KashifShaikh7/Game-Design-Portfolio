        This is my personal Subway Surfer-inspired endless runner, set in a post-apocalyptic world. Instead of running on railway tracks, 
        the player sprints down an abandoned road, dodging cars and collecting coins. I handled 
        character modeling, texturing, rigging, and level design, while using some ready-made assets for buildings and vehicles to 
        speed up development.

    <div class="project-description">

      The main idea was to make an endless runner game with zombies zunning behind a girl. And it somhow ended up
       being like subway surfer like runner. with no zombies and concept changed to boy running behind money. With a nice Iconic song's music (DK Bose)

        Whenever the game starts. It starts with a fixed first level that have nice space to get player ready. Then random levels come after this.

        <br><br><b>Level Designs :</b><br>

        I have multiple levels, all focusing on different situation to maintain the game flow. <br>
        Like traps, rewarding levels, decision making situations and speed over time.

        <b>Small details</b> in games sometimes just changes the feel of the game. When I was making this I really felt like, if you miss some small details
        like extra jump space and near coin attraction, the game feels a bit annoying. I was amazed that soo small things haves such a big impact on gameplay.

        <b>The Logic :</b> <br>
        Some years ago, I mostly wondered. That, how far can even subway surfer runner can go? And when I started making this, I realized we never have to move our runner.
        It just have to jump, and slide. So I just added the run animation to my character and moved the platforms/levels towards the player, to give a nice running effect. 
        This worked smoothly. The levels spawn in front of player, gets past the player and destroys.
